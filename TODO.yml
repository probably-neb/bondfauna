TODO:
  - Don't allow guesses that are not words
  - Color Schemes
  - Analyzer
  - words that aren't 5 long
  - sharing of results (like in regular wordle)
  - Server side components? (Will require moving my website off of github pages):
    - sql database with:
      - precomputed analyzer runs for all words
      - user info?
    - better storage of words:
      - client gets random chunk and chooses word from it?
      - client gets (single) answer from server each time
